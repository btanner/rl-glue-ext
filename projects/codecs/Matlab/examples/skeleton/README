RL-Glue Matlab SKELETON-SAMPLE README
=================================
----------------------------
Introduction
----------------------------
This is a sample experiment that has the "Skeleton" environment, agent, and experiment.  Hopefully this will provide useful scaffolding for your own projects.

This example requires the Matlab Codec:
http://glue.rl-community.org/Home/Extensions/matlab-codec

----------------------------
Running
----------------------------
- These instructions assume that you have installed the Matlab codec.  If not, you will need to add 'src' and all of its subdirectories to your Matlab path, and also you need the JavaRLGlueCodec.jar in your Matlab Java path.
- They also assume that you have rl_glue (or rl_glue.exe) installed on your path so that you don't have to type the full path to it.


-- Run All Together, Communicating over Sockets --
This is the easiest option, it will run the agent, environment, and experiment all together.

>> !rl_glue & %(maybe !rl_glue.exe& or !/path/to/rl_glue.exe&)
>> runAllTogether()


-- Running just one, or a subset in Matlab --
Please refer to the Matlab Codec Manual for more details.
