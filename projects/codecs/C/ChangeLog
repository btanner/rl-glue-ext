	  updated the link lines in other makefiles so that they work on

	  tests/test_rl_episode_experiment.c,
	  tests/test_sanity_experiment.c, tests/test_seeds_experiment.c:
	  Took config/saved_svn_version.txt out of subversion. I'll put it
	  in EXTRA_DIST so it gets included. It is replaced whenever we

	  about it not existing.

2008-09-15  Brian Tanner <brian@tannerpages.com>

	* [r130] Makefile.am, Makefile.in, config/saved_svn_version.txt,
	  configure, configure.ac: added examples to EXTRA_DIST

	* [r129] configure.ac: Changed 'libs' to 'lib' to just keep it less
	  complicated because default install location is /usr/local/lib

	  Added newline in useful_functions.h and removed rogue symbol in
	  test_seeds_environment.c to remove warnings in linux

	  tests/test_sanity_experiment.c, tests/test_seeds_environment.c,
	  tests/test_seeds_experiment.c, tests/useful_functions.c: Move to
	  using config.h for configuration, fixed make distcheck by putting
	  the test scripts into EXTRA_DIST, got the SVN version into
	  SVN_VERSION symbol using same trick as in RL-Glue, and now print
	  that out when we start up an agent/env/exp.

	  the codec will compile with the new RL-Glue types.

2008-09-07  Brian Tanner <brian@tannerpages.com>

	* [r96] src/RL_client_agent.c, src/RL_client_experiment.c,

	  and clients

	* [r95] examples/experiment/src/experiment.c,

	  src/Makefile.in: latest ignores and files included

	* [r88] config/ltmain.sh: the problem was ltmain.sh was a symlink
