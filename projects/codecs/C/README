Getting Started
----------------------------
This project is built with GNU autotools, so you should just need to do:
	$>./configure
	$>make
	$>sudo make install
	
This will install the necessary libraries and headers to:
	/usr/local/lib
	/usr/local/includes/rlglue
	
If you don't have sudo priviledges or you would like to install them somewhere else (Ex: your home directory):
	$>./configure --prefix=/path/to/your/home/directory         EG: /home/Users/btanner
	$>make
	$>make install
