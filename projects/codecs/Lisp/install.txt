-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Required libraries

    For RL-Glue CL codec.

        usocket (http://www.cliki.net/usocket)
        ieee-floats (http://www.cliki.net/ieee-floats)

    For RL-Glue utilities.

        cl-ppcre (http://www.cliki.net/CL-PPCRE)

2. Supported Lisp implementations

    The libraries required by the codec supports many Lisp implementations,
    the details can be found on their webpage. However the makefiles
    are prepared only for the SBCL, CMUCL, CLISP and openMCL lisp
    implementations.

3. Installation

    The sources can be turned into ASDF packages by the pack-asdf.sh script.

        chmod +x pack-asdf.sh (if necessary)
        ./pack-asdf.sh

    It creates the rl-glue-clcdc.tar.gz and the rl-glue-utils.tar.gz
    ASDF packages, which can be installed on the usual way.

    Installation with ASDF-Install (http://www.cliki.net/ASDF-Install).

        (asdf-install:install "/path/to/package/rl-glue-clcdc.tar.gz")
        (asdf-install:install "/path/to/package/rl-glue-utils.tar.gz")

    Manual installation.

        Extract the rl-glue-*.tar.gz into your lisp system source directory
        (e.g. /usr/share/common-lisp/source) and create a symlink to the
        rl-glue-*.asd file from the systems directory
        (e.g. /usr/share/common-lisp/systems).

4. Uninstallation

    Uninstallation with ASDF-Install (http://www.cliki.net/ASDF-Install).

        (asdf-install:uninstall :rl-glue-utils)
        (asdf-install:uninstall :rl-glue-clcdc)

    Manual uninstallation.

        Just symply delete the folder and the symlink created during the
        installation process.
