                       Installing the RL-Glue Lisp codec
                       ---------------------------------

    1. Required libraries
    2. Supported Lisp implementations

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Required libraries

    usocket (http://www.cliki.net/usocket)
    ieee-floats (http://www.cliki.net/ieee-floats)

2. Supported Lisp implementations

    The libraries used by the codec supports many Lisp implementations,
    the details can be found on their webpage. However the makefiles
    are prepared for the following lisp implementations.
    
        SBCL
        CMUCL
        CLISP
        OpenMCL (not tested yet)

    For any other implementation one has to install the codec manually.

3. Compiling and installing

    The used lisp implementation is autodetected by the makefiles.
    If more supported lisps are found the order is SBCL, CMUCL, CLISP, OpenMCL.
    If the default is not good, it can be overridden by the LISP environment
    variable. Its supported values are 'sbcl' for SBCL, 'lisp' for CMUCL,
    'clisp' for CLISP, 'ccl' for OpenMCL.

    Because CLISP does not provide the 'require' function, the path to
    the asdf.lisp file and the asd system definitions have to be specified
    (in a space separated way) by the LISP_PATH environment varaible.
    Because it has a default value (can be checked in rl-glue.makefile),
    most unix user can ignore its setting.
