                       Installing the RL-Glue Lisp codec
                       ---------------------------------

    1. Required libraries
    2. Supported Lisp implementations
    3. Trying the examples

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Required libraries

    usocket (http://www.cliki.net/usocket)
    ieee-floats (http://www.cliki.net/ieee-floats)
    cl-ppcre (http://www.cliki.net/CL-PPCRE)

2. Supported Lisp implementations

    The libraries required by the codec supports many Lisp implementations,
    the details can be found on their webpage. However the makefiles
    are prepared only for the SBCL, CMUCL, CLISP and openMCL lisp
    implementations.

3. Installing

    The sources can be turned into ASDF packages by the pack_asdf.sh script.

        ./pack_asdf.sh rl-glue-clcdc
        ./pack_asdf.sh rl-glue-utils

    Then then ASDF packages can be installed on the usual ways.

    Installation with ASDF-Install

        (asdf-install:install "/path/to/package/rl-glue-clcdc.tar.gz")
        (asdf-install:install "/path/to/package/rl-glue-utils.tar.gz")

    Manual installation

        Extract the rl-glue-*.tar.gz into your lisp system source directory
        (e.g. /usr/share/common-lisp/source) and create a symlink to the
        rl-glue-*.asd file from the systems directory
        (e.g. /usr/share/common-lisp/systems).

3. Trying the examples

    There are makefiles for the examples, which makes possible to try the codec
    without installation. The used lisp implementation (if supported) is
    autodetected by the makefiles. If more of them are found the order is
    SBCL, CMUCL, CLISP, OpenMCL. If the default is not good, it can be
    overridden by the LISP environment variable. Its supported values are
    'sbcl' for SBCL, 'lisp' for CMUCL, 'clisp' for CLISP, 'ccl' for OpenMCL.

    Because CLISP does not provide the 'require' function, the path to
    the asdf.lisp file and the asd system definitions have to be specified
    (in a space separated way) by the LISP_PATH environment varaible.
    Because it has a default value (can be checked in makefile.rl-glue),
    most unix user can ignore its setting.
