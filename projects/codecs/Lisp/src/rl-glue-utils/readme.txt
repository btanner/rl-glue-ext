1. Package of RL-Glue utilities

    The utilities are organized under the rl-glue-utils package.
    We recommend to use ASDF (http://www.cliki.net/asdf)
    to load the rl-glue-utils package.

        (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'rl-glue-utils)

    Required libraries are described on utility basis. Their summary
    can be checked in the rl-glue-utils.asd file.

2. Utility descriptions

    These descriptions and dependency requirements can be found in
    the own directories of the utilities.
